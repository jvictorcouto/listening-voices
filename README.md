Hello everyone!

This file have my study queue, my goals and everything that i'll put my hands on before start a certification studies.

I want to register here in this repository all my inputs in all tools that i'll touch in this journey and all the usefull links that i see around!

I hope this repository help someone someday.

I'm not a native english speaker, thanks for understanding.

Context: today i'm IT technician and i'm studying to be a cyber security engineer or something like that. This repository will cover the basics of any IT career but when i'll go deep i'll talking about cybersecutiry or information security.

Study subject queue:
- How to get help: Official Documentation, YouTube, Reddit, GitHub, ChatGPT, Phind, Google and community.
- Git and GitHub (we need to know documentate and share our codes and config files)
- Virtualization and Proxmox (I'll use Proxmox why i have an old desktop unused, if you cant setup a Proxmox server virtualize with your PC and skip all the Proxmox things)
- Operation Systems (I'll write about Linux and Windows here, and we will setup VMs and do basic configurations, installs, removes, simple comands, etc. Maybe i'll talk about BSD and MacOS)
- Network (here I'll brief all OSI and TCP/IP layers, only the necessary, we have so many best and more deatiled archives about this on the internet.
- Shell and PowerShell (in this point we will start to write scripts to make our life easy, everything able to automate will be automated)
- Firewall and Network Security (In this topic we will learn how to create a reliable firewall and make hackers life harder, we will talk about some firewalls solutions and network protocols)
- SSH & OS Hardening and encryption (when we will be here we starts a practice that will be present in almost all following steps, everything will have a strong auth method)
- Secret Management (with strong users, strong passwords and cryptographic keys we need a reliable system to manage all this things)
- Applications, webservers and databases (now is the time to use all the knowledge that we have to make a reliable structure and learn how any IT tool works (Unbound, Zabbix, GLPI, OCS, Backup tool, etc))
- Observabilty, Traffic and Log Analysis (here we will need to know what is going on with our machines and tools)
- Open Source SOC/NOC (maybe here we can stay by a long time, here we can explore all the blue team tools, i'll make sure you know what is blue team)
- Cloud and cloud security (this topic will be the basic of cloud that free tier allow, here we will made a little website and show to the world wide web or setup our dns server)
- GRC, audit, laws and ISOs (a overview about this topics is so much important why we ever will dealing with another people data)
- Technical Writing (this topic can be boring, but we need know how to speak everything we learned so far for non technical people, usually this people can fire us)

  I don't know how much time i'll need to cover all this topics, but i know the next step. I'll start learn how to smash all this progress with red team tools and i'll documentate all the process here.
